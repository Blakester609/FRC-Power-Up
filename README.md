# FRC-Power-Up
- Code for FRC Power Up robot
- This code is written using the WPILibrary for use on a roboRIO

### Things it does:

1. Has claw motors to bring the cube in and out
2. Has a winch to lift the cube up and over the switch
3. Has multiple autonomous codes for putting cube on switch or scale
   - Can use Limelight for autonomous for the switch
4. Has all-thread code to lift cube to scale (commented out)
   - Even uses limit switches to limit all-threads in only that direction!
